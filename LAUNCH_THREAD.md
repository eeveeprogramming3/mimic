## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I just built something that feels like magic.

Record yourself doing ANY task on your computer once.

AI watches, learns, and writes automation code that can replay it forever.

It's called Mimic. Here's how it works:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)

The problem with automation:

- Macro recorders are dumb (break if anything changes)
- Writing scripts takes hours
- No-code tools still need configuration

What if AI could just WATCH you do something and figure out how to repeat it?

---

## Tweet 3 (The Solution)

Mimic solves this:

1. Run `python mimic.py start task-name`
2. Do your task normally
3. Press Ctrl+C
4. Claude AI analyzes your screenshots + inputs
5. Generates a SKILL.md automation file

That's it. One command. One recording. Infinite replays.

## Tweet 4 (Technical)

Under the hood:

- Screenshots every 2 seconds (mss)
- Logs all mouse clicks + keyboard (pynput)
- Sends to Claude Opus with vision
- AI understands WHAT you did, not just WHERE you clicked
- Outputs structured skill files

~200 lines of Python. Open source.

## Tweet 5 (Use Cases)

Use cases I'm automating:

- Filing expense reports
- Data entry from emails
- Filling repetitive forms
- Browser-based workflows
- Anything you do more than twice

If you can do it, Mimic can learn it.

---

## Tweet 6 (CTA)

Mimic is free and open source.

GitHub: [link]

Built for Moltbot/Claude Code but works standalone.

Star it, fork it, break it, improve it.

What task would you automate first?

## Alternative Hook Tweets

**Option A:**
"What if your computer could watch you work once, then do it forever?"

I built exactly that. Thread.

**Option B:**
Spent 3 hours on a task I'll do 100 more times this year.

So I built a tool that watches me do it ONCE and automates the rest.

Open source. 200 lines. Works today.

**Option C:**
The laziest form of automation:

1. Do task once
2. Let AI figure out how to repeat it
3. Never do it again

Just shipped this. It's called Mimic.
